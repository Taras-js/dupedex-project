          "  I am over the moon with my first purchase from the Tatcha range. I have been on the hunt for the perfect cleanser that doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped bear and squeaky. This Rice Water Cleanser not only is luxuriously as soft as a pillow whilst applying, but has left my face feeling incredibly hydrated and also stripped off my full face of makeup with just a pea sized amount of product. ( usually I would have to double cleanse with other high end products to achieve these results )  I follow it up with the Tatcha cream, and I must say, it’s a match made in heaven for this dried lifeless looking skin. I feel revived and I feel like my skin has just thanked me by giving me a nice glow for what seems like the first time in awhile.",

I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",

This Rice Water Cleanser not only is luxuriously as soft as a pillow whilst applying, but has left my face feeling incredibly hydrated and also stripped off my full face of makeup with just a pea sized amount of product. ( usually I would have to double cleanse with other high end products to achieve these results )  I follow it up with the Tatcha cream, and I must say, it’s a match made in heaven for this dried lifeless looking skin.

      "  I bought this product a fortnight ago and use it daily.  It cleanses and removes all traces of makeup and gives me that luxuriously clean feeling after a shower.  I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",
