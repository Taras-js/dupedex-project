          "  I am over the moon with my first purchase from the Tatcha range. I have been on the hunt for the perfect cleanser that doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped bear and squeaky. This Rice Water Cleanser not only is luxuriously as soft as a pillow whilst applying, but has left my face feeling incredibly hydrated and also stripped off my full face of makeup with just a pea sized amount of product. ( usually I would have to double cleanse with other high end products to achieve these results )  I follow it up with the Tatcha cream, and I must say, it’s a match made in heaven for this dried lifeless looking skin. I feel revived and I feel like my skin has just thanked me by giving me a nice glow for what seems like the first time in awhile.",

Lo and behold, Tatcha Rice Wash came into my life and suddenly, HYDRATED SKIN!!!! I love it so much that I think this will turn into a lifelong thing.",

          "  I bought this product a fortnight ago and use it daily.  It cleanses and removes all traces of makeup and gives me that luxuriously clean feeling after a shower.  I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",

However since Frank Body have replaced the 'Everyday Face Moisturiser' with the 'Caffeinated Face moisturiser' I have tried again and again to use this product and it is very disappointing. Unfortunately I have found that this moisturiser cannot be used with any other products (including SPF/foundations/BBcreams) because of major pilling. Using the cream by itself is ok but not being able to use with with other products does make it spretty pointless addition to any skin care routine, which is why I would rate it a 2/5.",

Unfortunately I was a little disappointed, I loved the coffee smell, I also love that I felt my skin looked brighter and I loved the entry price point for incredible skincare products. - A big downfall for me was just how runny this product is! It has the consistency of literal cream (not thickened cream either, plain ol’ bulla cream) I’ve had to repackage the moisturizer into a tub to make it easier to use so I stop getting it literally everywhere but my face. One other thing that I think may also be due to the consistency - by the afternoon all of the product had slid off my face and I’m a greasy mess - something I haven’t experienced before with my skin (however not sure if this is just he moisturizer or if it’s not meshing well with my primer to form my base). I do believe Franks other products are awesome, unfortunately I can’t walk around with face wash and makeup to reapply every 6hrs to stop my face from sliding off :(",

If youre looking for something super hydrating I suggest you use this on top of something else, such as dabbing a little toner, essence, moisturizer first and following with a touch of this balm. Then there will be lots of hydration under a nice thick protecting product which will help with healing processes like acne scars and cuts.",

It's a versatile product and the product is super thick but I wouldn't call it a cream, it's more of a thick salve or balm. Nevertheless, I found it to be mediocre and rather expensive considering the ingredient list. I realised that it contained petroleum and that it was no different to other products that contain petroleum. For me, those products don't hydrate but rather just create a barrier for the skin. I would've liked to have seen a more natural ingredient list, one where it would actually hydrate my skin or dry patches. I also did not like how greasy it felt. It would just sit on top of my skin and it wouldn't even absorb, making my skin feel oily which I couldn't stand.",

The texture is a petroleum jelly type, but comes out of the tube very easily even though it is on the thicker side. It doesn't seem to absorb into the skin, but tends to sit on top of it with a somewhat oily feel and sheen to it. I apply this product nightly to my hands, elbows and the heels of my feet that get so rough even my husband has complained the dryness scratches his feet when I rub my feet across his. What a difference that from just using a couple of weeks have made, all that heel roughness is gone and no more scaly looking elbows.

This seemed to make the cracks heal faster and also made my hands overall softness better.  I really liked how long it seemed to last.  The biggest complaint is the smell.  It has a medicinal smell which I did not like which is kind of a deterrent to use while working so it was mainly a before bed kind of cream.",

I first used it on my cuticles, they are very dry and need help.  After applying it, I felt like I needed to wear gloves. Since the main ingredient is petroleum jelly, it doesn't rub in very well.  Plus, the smell is a bit too much for me and not very pleasant. I tried it on my lips, I had to take it off right away. I might try it on my feet this weekend when I can apply and just sit on the couch with socks on. This might work better for someone in the cold where your skin is always chapped and you don't care if your product smells good or not.",

Since it's a petroleum-based cream, I would consider it to be more of an ointment/occlusive rather than a cream. I prefer to use this at night because it has a strong, kinda unpleasant scent (my reason for 4 stars). I typically have dry skin and now that I'm using a prescription retinoid, my skin is even dryer, especially my lips! The EA Eight Hour® Cream Skin Protectant works perfectly as the last step in my evening skincare routine. I use a tiny bit on my face to seal in the moisture from my night cream. I also put a layer on my hands and on my lips to seal in the moisture there as well. My skin is practically glowing when I wake up in the morning and my lips are no longer chapped! Another way that I use it is on my feet before bed. I'll put some lotion on, then a layer of this cream, and then a pair of thick socks and by morning my feet are so moisturized. I love that this product is so versatile in it's applications. I would definitely recommend this to others, but it may not be for people who are sensitive to strong smells.",

It is very sticky and greasy like petroleum jelly. As a matter of fact, the ingredients label states it is 56.8% petrolatum. I don't necessarily mind that because I have very dry skin but it was not what I was expecting based on the label! Now as far as effectiveness, it really does work very well! My hands felt very hydrated and soft all day. I recommend putting it on after washing hands so you can seal in all the moisture and get maximum moisturization. Keep in mind it is going to need a little time to absorb due to the thick texture. Sadly, the scent is just too much for me. It's hard to describe the smell, it's definitely not floral, maybe like a soapy medicinal smell. It's also pretty strong. Honestly it reminds me of my grandma - sorry grandma! I really like the cream based on how it works but I would go for the fragrance-free version if you are sensitive to smells.",

I would start a product and it would mildly get better but then come back. Once I started using this cream, the dry patch went away and stayed away! The cream is a little thicker and has an orange tint to it. There is a very mild scent, but not too overwhelming. I would not recommend using it on your face as it is a little oily. On the rest of my body, I use it daily for dry patches. Highly recommend this product!",

It goes on smooth, but it does make your hands feel and look pretty greasy at first. It has 56.8% Petrolatum in it so that accounts for the greasy look. I was taken a back at first with the look, but it does clear up after five minutes or so. It did leave my hands looking and feeling moisturized.",

My first impression was of slight concern upon finding no expiration date and a lack of a foil seal or plastic wrap on the tube. I was also expecting a cream (thick lotion texture), but instead I found the consistency similar to that of a tacky toothpaste gel, likely due to the active ingredient of petroleum. The orange color of the product was unexpected, and the product had a slight chemical smell. When applied, it left a glossy sheen that did not absorb quickly. While I personally did not like that greasy feeling, it did help keep the area well moisturized for an extended time. I appreciated the versatility of the product, which could be applied to moisturize hands, feet, lips and even used as a brow gel! I was also impressed with how well it softened my cuticles after only a few applications.",

It worked really good from the first application and I can see marked difference in dryness.2. I have applied every other day and it seems to work good for me. Probably, I would apply more regularly. 3. I do not find it sticky and could easily apply.4. Although not sure whether I can do so, I used it on my chapped lips and it seemed to have worked wonders.

        review_text: "  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The first thing I noticed was the actual bottle of skin protectant when I opened the box. It is a nice box. The actual bottle itself is heavy duty too. I know that seems a little weird to talk about, but the bottle itself is high quality and because of that, I don't expect any punctures in the bottle or anything like that. Opening the container is really easy. The lid just twists and opens. Then you just twist it back on when you are done. The cream itself comes out fairly quick. That's not a bad thing but just wanted people to be aware. And you only need a little bit! A little bit goes a long way. The cream itself is kind of an orange color. I wasn't expecting that, but it does not leave your skin looking orange! It goes on smoothly too and it is not too oily or sticky! You can actually use this on your lips to protect them and to heal them.. or on any part of your body! You can also use it in your hair to help with dry ends! It is very versatile! I personally have dry skin and this works so well to help keep it moisturized and feeling a little better! Another thing I love about this product is that it lasts a long time. You don't need to use a lot, and it lasts a long time.. what better combo is there than that? You can reapply if you need to but I only need to use it one or 2 times a day depending on how dry my skin is. The only downside to this product that I have found, is the smell! It smells weird. To me at least! I don't really like the smell but after a while it goes away. It's just that initial whiff you get when you apply it. You get used to it after a while though. That is the only thing about it that I don't like. The rest of it is amazing! I can't wait to get more of it when I run out. I will be letting family and friends know about it too! I think everyone should give this a shot. It's so versatile!Pros: Quality, Long Lasting, Don't need a lotCons: Smell",

        review_text: "  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] An eight hour skin protectant claim, I'm sure you can imagine I was skeptical. First, I am going to state the obvious, this does not smell pleasant at all. As a matter of fact, it smells horrible! I would never put this on my face as suggested because I don't think I could take the smell. I used this on my hands the first time I tried it as you can see from the photos, it gives your skin a nice sheen. Having said that, with any petrolatum product you can also expect this to be extremely thick and greasy on your skin. It does wash off with soap with and water though.I started using this on my feet at night and on my legs because they get so dry and flaky this has really cleared up better than anything else I have used and I don't have to reapply constantly. So, it really is a good product and it really does work, you can feel the instant relief in your dry skin when you apply it and for someone that gets painful cracks this just wonderful feeling! If you have dry skin need or want something to protect you while you are out in the elements, I believe this is definitely worth trying. Tip: Put it on at night when you're sleeping so you don't have to smell it.",

After applying my usual under eye nigh cream, I will apply this over it to lock in the cream & add even more moisture. WOW! The next morning my under eye area, which is normally filled with unwanted creases, lines and crows feet, looked so much more refreshed, and YOUNGER!!! I was ECSTATIC! Because any woman who struggles with any of the things mentioned above, would be happy about finding something to help with that!! My only complaint, which isn't even a big deal and it isn't a deal breaker at all, is that it smells a little medicinal. The scent could improve.

Just an hour after applying this on my lips made my lips felt so hydrated and I can feel the rough skin almost like it's exfoliating on its own! I am very impressed. I can definitely see this healing the KP on my arms! It's too early to say but for anything else that needs instant hydration, this is what you need. I highly recommend it. Also lastly, I want to add that this product has a very  medicinal and strange smell to it. That is the only reason I gave it a four star.

It smells very medicinal, especially when you're initially putting it on. The smell does fade within 15 to 20 minutes. It is certainly not a product you put on to feel pampered or to relax. It is more of a heavy duty ointment type product, rather than a soothing cream or lotion. The consistency is a bit like petroleum jelly. I have used it on my hands, and it feels a bit greasy/sticky initially, but does sink in within about 5 minutes. It's interesting, because it's not one where you can really rub it in very deep, you just have to let it absorb on its own. I just used it for general dry hands/cuticles, but it seems like it could be good if you were having more severe issues like chapped skin or something. Because of the texture, I wouldn't be keen to put it on my face. I have acne-prone skin and it seems like it would clog my pores or make me break out. I'm surprised this is such a fan favorite.

I like this cream because I like to put it on at night to absorb all night into my skin while I sleep. I also put it on in the morning and it lasts all day. This cream isn't greasy at all and absorbs really quickly. I put a little bit of this cream on my nail cuticles and they look so much healthier now than before. My lips seem to get chapped a lot in the winter months so I wanted to try this product on them, my lips are not chapped anymore. I like how versatile this product is, it can be used all over your body. The heels of my feet were cracked and I put a little bit of this product on them and my heels were not longer cracked after a couple of days. This is truly the miracle cream for sure. I like that this product is 1.7 ozs so I can take it with me on vacation this summer overseas.

It has a stronger smell which doesn’t bother me however it’s thick so that is why I prefer to use at night. You can tell it’s good quality since a very little amount goes a long way! Would recommend!like how you can use it on your lips and also for sun burn and chapped skin so many useful things to do with this product",

        review_text: "  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a good moisturizer, works well for locking in skins moisture. I found it works best after a bath or shower. Because your skin in already wet. This is a petroleum based moisturizer so having damp skin is key when using this. It is not a lotion or cream, therefore it is a very greasy product. You only need a small amount. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn’t for the greasy feel it leaves behind. But that being said this product does what it says it will",

I have normal skin, but still use a moisturizer day and night, and I’m always looking for the perfect one. This one has a medicinal smell, and it is very tacky.  It’s way too heavy and greasy to be a daily moisturizer for my skin type. The second time I used it, I put in only on my lips and heels of my feet. That was a much better fit. Both felt moisturized and the product was long lasting, especially on my lips. Still, I don’t think I would recommend this because I don’t think I will use it enough. There’s nothing about it that I like enough to use it regularly. I’ll likely and unfortunately add this product to the list of creams and bottles under my sink that are rarely used and often forgotten.",

        review_text: "  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am, unfortunately, cursed with permanently chapped lips and am always in search of relief. Elizabeth Arden's more gel-like balm (not really what I would call a cream) is a wonderful overnight treatment that brings much needed hydration to my lips. I add a nice coating but you don't need to glop it on, a little goes a long way. I also like to add the lightest touch to the sides and tip of my nose as they tend to be my driest spot on my face and have seen much less skin peeling. My one qualm with the product is that the scent isn't my favorite and right out of the tube it is a little powerful. Once applied the scent does dissipate and isn't a problem. Can't wait to find new uses for this powerful little multi-tasker.",

The only negative I didn't like was the smell it was different it wasn't good or bad just different. The smell did not linger once applied.

Not only did my skin texture become smoother and hydrated, but it felt moisturized and soothed.  I’m adding pics that show my hands side by side right after application, and the three hours after application.  The difference is astounding!

It helped the irritated skin as well!My only real con for this product is that it has a 'mature' scent.

It smells exactly like resin, the tree kind of resin, EXACTLY, I didn't like the smell at all in the beginning, probably because I couldn't figure out what it was, but once I did it became much more pleasant. It also works wonders on scabs and flakey skin from for example, a pimple, I put a generous amount of this on my pimple a while before I'm doing my makeup, and the pimple scab/dryness just peels right off without any effort, which makes the makeup look so much better. I would repurchase, the price is worth it, since it replaces so many of your other products, if I ever run out, you don't need much when you use it.",

The sun was so strong with the reflection off the snow, my lips were cracked, with sores and bleeding.  I had sunscreen on to no avail given where I was.  I put the cream on my lips and all around my mouth.  My sores, blisters and cut lip were gone the next morning.  Without a word of a lie. No one in the group could believe it.

I apply it to my entire face, lips, and hands every night. It doesn't smell as bad as everyone says it does. It does have an odd smell though, but it's just something you need to get use to. The texture of the cream is kind of like Vaseline, and it has a orange peachy color to it. It does soak into your skin pretty well but it also leaves a greasy after feel. In the morning I use it to brighten my eyes a little if I am not wearing mascara, I apply the cream to my eyelashes after curling them and it defines each lash a little more. I think this stuff is great! Not for $20 though, so I would try to find it some where else for half the price. Great product!",

The scent of citronella is immensely overpowering for a whole body cream. So glad I did not apply it all over me, as I have just washed my arm for the third time and it still smells like bug spray.

Although 8 hour cream is not the sort of thing I'd use as a moisturiser(it has no water content, and therefore will never absorb) I have used it to heal the marks left by the odd pimple on my face. It's also really, really good for wound healing (according to legend that's how got it's name...by healing a graze on a boy's knee in eight hours!). It's also great for fading scars. The lanolin smell doesn't really worry me, but the 'flavor' can be a bit strong if used on the lips. The only downside for me would have to be that it contains a paraben preservative. All-in-all though, it's a must-have!",

I've even used it on my cuticles. I always pack this if I'm going away as I never know when my next skin emergency will happen. Beware though it has a very distinctive smell and and a thick consistency - gel or balm might have been better, or for an increased sense of accuracy, gloop. I've never been able to use it on my lips as the smell puts me off but some people do love it.

I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",

I read another comment about it smelling like pink soap that nearly put me off purchasing. I vaguely get the comparison but I personally really like the fragrance...it is so light and not overpowering in the slightest. I think they've used the bare minimum fragrance to mask the natural smells of the various ingredients...to me it smells wonderfully clinical and fresh. Will be rebuying.",

I’ve been using up all my samples and thought I’d give it a go and OMG it’s beautiful! It’s really lightly fragranced but not offensive and it doesn’t linger. It was the perfect moisturiser to use on my wintery dry skin. I normally have super oily all over skin but this winter I have dry patches. This cream is perfect for both skin types and wasn’t sticky at all. I used it under makeup spread fairly thin and also as a thicker night mask. Both with great results. I’m buying the full size I loved it so much",

I have dry to normal skin (eczema , hormonal acne & can get really oily when my skin isnt hydrated enough!)  and this moisturiser has just balanced my skin ! hydrated and fresh and doesn't feel like I have anything on my face. I use Vit C oil from sunday riley underneath and works wonders :)",
