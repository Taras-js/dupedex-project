          "  I am over the moon with my first purchase from the Tatcha range. I have been on the hunt for the perfect cleanser that doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped bear and squeaky. This Rice Water Cleanser not only is luxuriously as soft as a pillow whilst applying, but has left my face feeling incredibly hydrated and also stripped off my full face of makeup with just a pea sized amount of product. ( usually I would have to double cleanse with other high end products to achieve these results )  I follow it up with the Tatcha cream, and I must say, it’s a match made in heaven for this dried lifeless looking skin. I feel revived and I feel like my skin has just thanked me by giving me a nice glow for what seems like the first time in awhile.",

Lo and behold, Tatcha Rice Wash came into my life and suddenly, HYDRATED SKIN!!!! I love it so much that I think this will turn into a lifelong thing.",

          "  I bought this product a fortnight ago and use it daily.  It cleanses and removes all traces of makeup and gives me that luxuriously clean feeling after a shower.  I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",

However since Frank Body have replaced the 'Everyday Face Moisturiser' with the 'Caffeinated Face moisturiser' I have tried again and again to use this product and it is very disappointing. Unfortunately I have found that this moisturiser cannot be used with any other products (including SPF/foundations/BBcreams) because of major pilling. Using the cream by itself is ok but not being able to use with with other products does make it spretty pointless addition to any skin care routine, which is why I would rate it a 2/5.",

I thought wow this is a great product but considering it ticked all my boxes of a perfect cream it would probably be quite expensive but to my surprise, it was way cheaper than what I was anticipating this product to be.

The scent of citronella is immensely overpowering for a whole body cream. So glad I did not apply it all over me, as I have just washed my arm for the third time and it still smells like bug spray.

        review_text: "  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who said that this is an ointment rather than a cream. Although 8 hour cream is not the sort of thing I'd use as a moisturiser(it has no water content, and therefore will never absorb) I have used it to heal the marks left by the odd pimple on my face. It's also really, really good for wound healing (according to legend that's how got it's name...by healing a graze on a boy's knee in eight hours!). It's also great for fading scars. The lanolin smell doesn't really worry me, but the 'flavor' can be a bit strong if used on the lips. The only downside for me would have to be that it contains a paraben preservative. All-in-all though, it's a must-have!",

I've even used it on my cuticles. I always pack this if I'm going away as I never know when my next skin emergency will happen. Beware though it has a very distinctive smell and and a thick consistency - gel or balm might have been better, or for an increased sense of accuracy, gloop. I've never been able to use it on my lips as the smell puts me off but some people do love it.

I wanted a product that did not require me to use a liquid make up remover.  I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.  Mecca staff are so brilliant in recommending products that suit my skin and my lifestyle - gotta love that!Give it a try - you really will not regret it!",

I read another comment about it smelling like pink soap that nearly put me off purchasing. I vaguely get the comparison but I personally really like the fragrance...it is so light and not overpowering in the slightest. I think they've used the bare minimum fragrance to mask the natural smells of the various ingredients...to me it smells wonderfully clinical and fresh. Will be rebuying.",

I’ve been using up all my samples and thought I’d give it a go and OMG it’s beautiful! It’s really lightly fragranced but not offensive and it doesn’t linger. It was the perfect moisturiser to use on my wintery dry skin. I normally have super oily all over skin but this winter I have dry patches. This cream is perfect for both skin types and wasn’t sticky at all. I used it under makeup spread fairly thin and also as a thicker night mask. Both with great results. I’m buying the full size I loved it so much",

I use Vit C oil from sunday riley underneath and works wonders :)",
