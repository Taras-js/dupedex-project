This Rice Water Cleanser not only is luxuriously as soft as a pillow whilst applying, but has left my face feeling incredibly hydrated and also stripped off my full face of makeup with just a pea sized amount of product. ( usually I would have to double cleanse with other high end products to achieve these results )  I follow it up with the Tatcha cream, and I must say, it’s a match made in heaven for this dried lifeless looking skin. I feel revived and I feel like my skin has just thanked me by giving me a nice glow for what seems like the first time in awhile.",

I wear very heavy eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara and needed a single product to remove it all - along with my usual foundation / powders.  I love the Tatcha range because it is gentle but hardworking on my skin.  This particular product is going to be my go-to cleanser from now on.

      "  I purchased this product hoping to use it as a cleanser and exfoliating combo. It's not grainy at all and feels like just a cream cleanser. It smells great but doesn't exfoliate as I'd hoped.",

    review_text:
      "  This is a good, solid cleanser however I sometimes need to double cleanse to get makeup off properly, especially mascara (I don’t use waterproof mascara) which also dries out my skin. It has a nice, sort of sweet smell and the exfoliant is very general and suitable for every day use. It is a good product but I won’t be making it my go-to cleanser.",
